.SH NAME
.B sid-filter
- SPF and Sender-ID filter for sendmail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sid-filter
-p socketspec [-a peerlist] [-A] [-B] [-c] [-C cmin] [-d domains] [-D] [-f] [-h] [-H name] [-l] [-L level] [-M text] [-n] [-P pidfile] [-q] [-Q] [-r rmode] [-R rmin] [-t] [-T secs] [-u userid] [-V]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sid-filter
implements the SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and Microsoft, Inc.'s
Sender-ID experimental proposals for validating the sending/relaying host
of a piece of e-mail.

Details regarding the protocol and other issues related to the proposals
can be found in RFC4406 (Sender ID) and RFC4408 (SPF).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -a peerlist
Identifies a file of "peers" which identifies clients whose connections
should be accepted without processing by this filter.  The
.I peerlist
should contain on each line a hostname, domain name (e.g. ".example.com"),
IP address, an IPv6 address (including an IPv4 mapped address), or a
CIDR-style IP specification (e.g. "192.168.1.0/24").  An entry beginning
with a bang ("!") character means "not", allowing exclusions of specific
hosts that are otherwise members of larger sets.  The order of entries
in this file is therefore significant.
.TP
.I -A
Automatically re-start on failures.  Use with caution; if the filter
fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a tight
.I fork(2)
loop.
.TP
.I -B
Use "best-guess processing" when a domain has no published policy.
This means a "NXDOMAIN" code returned from the nameserver will cause
a policy of "v=spf1 a/24 mx/24 ptr ?all" to be applied on behalf of
the purported sender of the message.
.TP
.I -c
Continue processing messages when the Purported Responsible Address
(PRA), the main parameter to Sender ID evaluations, cannot be determined.
By default, such messages are rejected.
.TP
.I -C cmin
When doing Cloudmark Rating checks, require that the reported confidence
of the returned rating be at least 
.I cmin
to be meaningful.
.TP
.I -d domain[,...]
A comma-separated list of domains whose mail should be ignored by this
filter.
.TP
.I -D
Treat DNS errors as soft failures and allow delivery, rather than telling the
filter to temp-fail the message and try again later.
.TP
.I -f
Normally
.I sid-filter
forks and exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it runs in the foreground.
.TP
.I -h
Causes
.I sid-filter
to add a header indicating the presence of this filter in the path of
the message from injection to delivery.  The product's name, version, and
the job ID are included in the header's contents.
.TP
.I -H name
Use the specified
.I name
when adding identifying or results headers rather than the hostname being
used by the MTA.
.TP
.I -l
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
any interesting activity.
.TP
.I -L level
Request logging of libmarid activity to the
.B syslog
daemon at LOG_DEBUG level.  The
.I level
parameter refers to the log level inside libmarid, not the log level
used by the daemon.
.TP
.I -M message
Sets the SMTP rejection message to be returned by the MTA when messages
are rejected by the filter; the text may contain tokens for
substitution as follows:
.I %a
(the e-mail address which was evaluated),
.I %e
(the error message returned from libmarid, if any),
.I %i
(the IP address of the connecting client),
.I %t
(which test was applied, i.e. the string "Sender-ID" or the string "SPF"), and
.I %%
(a literal percent-sign character).
.TP
.I -n
Don't use "spf1" (SPF) records for PRA (Sender-ID) scope checks.
.TP
.I -p socketspec
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.I sendmail(8)
in order to provide service.
.I socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.I local:path
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.I path,
or
.I inet:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.I port.
If the
.I host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  This option is mandatory.
.TP
.I -P pidfile
Writes the process ID of the filter, once started, to the filename given.
.TP
.I -q
Quarantine rejected messages rather than actually rejecting them.
.TP
.I -Q
Quiet logging; requests that no informational messages be logged, only
warnings and errors.
.TP
.I -r rmode
Sets the rejection mode for the filter.  Valid values are: 0, which accepts
all mail (but still adds a status header); 1, which rejects mail if both
the Sender ID and SPF tests report "fail"; 2, which rejects mail if
either the Sender ID or SPF test reports "fail"; 3, which rejects mail unless
either the Sender ID or SPF test reports "pass"; 4, which rejects mail
unless both the Sender ID and SPF tests report "pass"; or 5, which rejects
mail for which a "fail" from either test unless a "pass" was reported by
the other.
The default is 0.
.TP
.I -R rmin
Requests queries of the sender against the Cloudmark Rating engine, and
reports those results in a header.  The message will be reported to "fail"
this check unless the reported rating is at least
.I rmin.
See also -C.
.TP
.I -t
Test mode; never reject a message, even if the responsible sender could not
be determined.  By default, such messages are temp-failed.
.TP
.I -T secs
Sets the DNS timeout in seconds.  A value of 0 causes the package to wait
forever for DNS replies.  The default is 5.  Note that this only applies
if the asynchronous resolver is in use; if the native resolver is used,
no timeout facility is available.  See also the NOTES section below.
.TP
.I -u userid
Attempts to be come the specified
.I userid
before starting operations.
.TP
.I -V
Print the version number and exit without doing anything else.
.SH OPERATION
When a connection arrives, the headers are accepted and stored.  At the end
of the headers, the "responsible sender" is determined based on headers
as per the Sender-ID specification (or the envelope sender for the SPF
evaluation).  The filter then attempts to extract an e-mail policy for the
responsible sender domain.  When the policy has been evaluated, the
result is relayed via the addition of an Authentication-Results: header
field.
.SH NOTES
When setting timeouts (see the
.I -T
option above), be careful not to select a timeout value that exceeds
the timeouts being used between
.I sendmail
and the filter.  Otherwise, the MTA could give up waiting for a reply
from the filter before the filter times out waiting for a DNS result.
