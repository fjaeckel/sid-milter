This is the development area for Sendmail's implementation of Microsoft's
SenderID e-mail authorization mechanism.

Project lead:		n/a
Lead engineer:		Murray S. Kucherawy <msk@sendmail.com>
Product manager:	n/a

The filter implemented here, if plugged into the Sendmail MTA, provides
authorized sender verification as per Microsoft's SenderID specification.


COMPILING
=========

Requires sendmail v8.13.0 or later, for required milter protocol
enhancements.

See notes in the Makefile.m4 file before compiling.


DEBUG FEATURES
==============

The SIDDEBUG environment variable, if set, specifies debugging options to
be applied by the filter.

The contents of SIDDEBUG should be a string containing characters representing
the required debug options as depicted in this list:

(currently none)


REJECTION LEVELS
================

Here is a representation of the decision tables used at each of the rejection
levels ("-r" command line option).

SENDER-ID	SPF	0	1	2	3	4	5
pass		pass	accept	accept	accept	accept	accept	accept
pass		neutral	accept	accept	accept	accept	reject	accept
pass		fail	accept	accept	accept	accept	reject	accept
neutral		pass	accept	accept	accept	reject	reject	accept
neutral		neutral	accept	accept	accept	reject	reject	accept
neutral		fail	accept	accept	accept	reject	reject	reject
fail		pass	accept	accept	reject	reject	reject	accept
fail		neutral	accept	accept	reject	reject	reject	reject
fail		fail	accept	reject	reject	reject	reject	reject
