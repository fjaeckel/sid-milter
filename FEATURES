In the source code for this package may be one or more segments of code
that are disabled, as they are slated for future release (FFR).  These
are generally unreleased or incomplete features, or can be new algorithms
for existing features.  They are often untested and currently unsupported,
and generally formally become part of the released software in some future
revision.  There may or may not be documentation for them outside of this
file.  Use them at your own risk.

To enable an FFR in the source code, find the feature you want to use
in the list below and arrange to enable that feature at build time by
adding -D_FFR_<feature-name> to the build.  For example, to add the WIDGET
feature, you would add -D_FFR_WIDGET to the build.  You would do this
by adding a line to Makefile.m4 that reads:

	APPENDDEF(`confENVDEF', `-D_FFR_WIDGET')


Feature Name	Description

NH_MFROM	(sid-filter) From Dick St. Peters of NetHeaven:
		This adds "spf2.0/mfrom" and "spf2.0/pra,mfrom" to the tags
		for SPF-classic checks, and it also makes SPF-classic checks
		ignore "spf2.0/pra" records that do not also specify "mfrom".

		This extension will raise cries of anguish from some people,
		but most domains publishing "mfrom" tags probably intend what
		this code does.
